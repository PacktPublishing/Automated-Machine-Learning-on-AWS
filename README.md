This is the code repository for [Automated Machine Learning on AWS](https://www.packtpub.com/product/automated-machine-learning-on-aws/9781801811828?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781801811828), published by Packt.

**Fast-track the development of your production-ready machine learning applications the AWS way**

## What is this book about?
AWS provides a wide range of solutions to help automate a machine learning workflow with just a few lines of code. With this practical book, you'll learn how to automate a machine learning pipeline using the various AWS services.
Automated Machine Learning on AWS begins with a quick overview of what the machine learning pipeline/process looks like and highlights the typical challenges that you may face when building a pipeline.

This book covers the following exciting features: 
* Employ SageMaker Autopilot and Amazon SageMaker SDK to automate the machine learning process
* Understand how to use AutoGluon to automate complicated model building tasks
* Use the AWS CDK to codify the machine learning process
* Create, deploy, and rebuild a CI/CD pipeline on AWS
* Build an ML workflow using AWS Step Functions and the Data Science SDK
* Leverage the Amazon SageMaker Feature Store to automate the machine learning software development life cycle (MLSDLC)
* Discover how to use Amazon MWAA for a data-centric ML process

For supplemental content that covers updates to AWS capabilities, such as SageMaker Pipelines, as well as advanced features for production ML model monitoring, take a look at [www.automatedmlonaws.com](https://www.automatedmlonaws.com/).

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders.

The code will look like the following:
```
import boto3
import sagemaker
aws_region = sagemaker.Session().boto_session.region_name
!sm-docker build --build-arg REGION={aws_region} 
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This book is for the novice as well as experienced machine learning practitioners looking to automate the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning-based solutions into production, using both purpose-built and other AWS services. 
A basic understanding of the end-to-end machine learning process and concepts, Python programming, and AWS is necessary to make the most out of this book.	.	

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-11).
